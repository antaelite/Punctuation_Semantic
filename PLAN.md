# Replication Plan: Exploiting Punctuation Semantics in Continuous Data Streams

- **Original Paper:** Tucker et al. (2003) `Exploiting Punctuation Semantics in Continuous Data Streams`
- **Target System:** Apache Flink (Java)
- **Team Members:** Anta Gueye, Louis Kusno, Jassir Habba

## Objective

The goal of this project is to reproduce the memory optimization techniques described in the paper using a modern streaming engine (Apache Flink). Specifically, we aim to demonstrate how **Punctuation Semantics** can allow unbounded stateful operators to function efficiently on infinite streams by clearing state early.
